# Classification
## Perceptron
- works only if the two classes are linearly separable
### Terminology
- epochs:
  number of passed over the training dataset
- if the dimentions are not linearly seperable no matter how many itteration we choose the perceptron would never stop updatig the weight.
## Binary classification to multi-class classificatio:
### one-versus-all(OvA)
- OvA or one-versus-rest(OvR)
